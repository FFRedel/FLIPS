Read.me FLIPS

'Main' file contains the general example/problem of this package. The problem presented is a denoising problem with the Sparse Coding problem 
Min_f       ||f||_1 
s.t.        ||x – Df||_2 <= epsilon

The problem is solved with the oracles and state-of-the-art algorithms presented in the paper.
